/**
 * This is the provided NumberTriangle class to be used in this coding task.
 *
 * Note: This is like a tree, but some nodes in the structure have two parents.
 *
 * The structure is shown below. Observe that the parents of e are b and c, whereas
 * d and f each only have one parent. Each row is complete and will never be missing
 * a node. So each row has one more NumberTriangle object than the row above it.
 *
 *                  a
 *                b   c
 *              d   e   f
 *            h   i   j   k
 *
 * Also note that this data structure is minimally defined and is only intended to
 * be constructed using the loadTriangle method, which you will implement
 * in this file. We have not included any code to enforce the structure noted above,
 * and you don't have to write any either.
 *
 *
 * See NumberTriangleTest.java for a few basic test cases.
 *
 * Extra: If you decide to solve the Project Euler problems (see main),
 *        feel free to add extra methods to this class. Just make sure that your
 *        code still compiles and runs so that we can run the tests on your code.
